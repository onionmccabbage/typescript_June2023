Review Exercise 3
================= 
optional - teams or individual, breakout roms, interpret however...
Build an app where the user can access data from the Star Wars API at
    https://swapi.dev/api/
 
The API allows several categories of search such as people, planets, species or starships
Pass in the category and an IDs
  e.g. https://swapi.dev/api/people/1 (use back tick syntax)
Show results nicely   

Notes:
- consider an observable for the category (but you dont HAVE to use)
- can we use an enum for the 'category' field (or retreive from API)
- handle out-of-bounds parameters (e.g. no such category. 404 etc.)
- aim for modular composition
- handle server problems (SWAPI vehicles fail for some IDs)

Optional
--------
You could write a generator to yield the next (sequential) item from the server
Your types/interfaces could be in separate modules
Each category item returns a list of film URLs - fetch those films too

Alternative
-----------
If you pefer, work on a real API you have
Or just add functionality to your 'users' project from earlier
