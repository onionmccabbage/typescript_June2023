Review Exercise 2
=================

Interpret however you like - individual or teamwork, show-and-tell after

Build an app to retrieve user data from the API at
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

You will need an interface for 'Users' but only include a few members

Optionally combine users with their todos and/or photos etc.
The available nested routes are:
    /posts/1/comments
    /albums/1/photos 
    /users/1/albums
    /users/1/todos
    /users/1/posts

Ideally, build the URL using back-tick interpolation

Show a nice collection of the ten users, and optionally their photo collections or their 'completed' todos
- e.g. on the web page (preferred)
- or use console.log and string interpolation within VS Code (cannot use fetch if you do this.)

Handle exceptions (catch)
type-safe the Promise
use async/await

If you like, download the JSON and do it all offline (no fetch) or try NodeFetch (look it up)

Optional
========
Provide a way to parameterize which user to retrieve (i.e. ask in the web page)
How could you offer a filter (say photos by user or todos by complete)...

NB the API also permits fake delete, post and (real) filter - see the API documentation

consider making interfaces for Address etc. then compose the 'User' interface
